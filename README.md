# Golden spiral
Golden Spirals are a common phenomena in nature. From the shape of how sea shells are formed, to how leaves are placed on a branch, to the ubiquitous Sunflower seed arrangement all are represented by the Golden Spiral.

Golden Spiral is a logarithamic spiral, which is denoted by the greek letter phi. This logarithamic spiral is closely related the the Fibonacci Series. Read about [Fibonacci Series here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

Also a wonderful explanation of how Golden Ratio is calculated and how it occurs in nature is given at [MathIsFun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/nature-golden-ratio-fibonacci.html)

The Golden spiral built here is in p5js and the spiral's hue is determined by its position from the center. Do try various possibilities to see more on this.
